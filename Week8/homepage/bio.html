              D’s Kitchen is a rock band from Bangalore, India. Formed in 2015, the band relies on simplicity
              and impactful, emotive songwriting to form a unique, yet effective sound.
              The band’s sound can be generally classified as rock, though it has elements of indie, blues,
              grunge and other genres, the use of which comes from the different musical journeys of the
              band’s members.
              <br>
              The band released its first album, Light Does Echo in January 2016 to positive reviews. The band
              released its second full-length release, This Side Of The Border, in August 2017. The album
              release will be accompanied by an extensive India tour.
              <br>
              The band also shot a live performance of the new album along with unreleased material, which
              was telecast on Kappa TV as part of their ‘Music Mojo’ program. The telecast will release on
              Youtube as well in the coming days. In the last few months the band has played at various
              venues in Bengaluru, Goa and Pondicherry to support the release.
              <br>
              The lineup consists of Rohit Kamath on vocals, Vaibhav Kumar and Himanshu Arora on guitars,
              Nipun Narayan on bass guitar, and Madhusudan Raman on drums.
